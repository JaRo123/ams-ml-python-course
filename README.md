# ams-ml-python-course
Machine Learning in Python for Environmental Science Problems AMS Short Course Material

## Requirements
The modules for this short course require Python 3.6 and the following Python libraries:
* numpy
* scipy
* matplotlib
* xarray
* netcdf4
* pandas 
* scikit-learn
* tensorflow-gpu or tensorflow
* keras
* shapely
* descartes
* jupyter
* ipython
* jupyterlab
* ipywidgets

The current pre-compiled version of tensorflow-gpu requires your machine to have an NVIDIA GPU, CUDA 9.0, CUDA Toolkit 9.0, and cuDNN 7. If you have different versions of CUDA available, you will have to build Tensorflow from source, which can take a few hours.

GPUs are recommended for modules 3 and 4 but are not needed for modules 1 and 2.
